## Project Overview

This is a modern, fully responsive **one-page product landing website** built using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and the **Bootstrap 4.3.1** framework.

The primary goal of this project was to showcase effective front-end development skills by:

* Creating a visually engaging brand presence for a fictional product.
* Mastering **Bootstrap's Grid System** and components to ensure seamless adaptability across all devices.
* Implementing custom CSS to add unique styling beyond the base framework.

### Highlights

* **Fully Responsive Design (RWD):** The layout utilizes the Bootstrap grid system to ensure optimal display and usability on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop monitors.
* **Custom Visual Branding:**
    * The site features a vibrant **CSS `linear-gradient` background** (from `#00F490` to `#00BBC9`), moving beyond flat design.
    * Custom **text shadows** (`.drop-shadow`) are applied to critical headings, enhancing legibility against the gradient background.
    * **Google Fonts** are used strategically: `Abril Fatface` for headlines and `Open Sans` for body text.
* **Bootstrap Component Usage:** Successfully integrated and customized the **Jumbotron** component by making its background transparent (`background-color: rgba(..., 0)`), allowing the content to sit directly on the custom gradient.
